Observations on LazyInitializedSingleton Class
The LazyInitializedSingleton class is a simple implementation of the Singleton design pattern, which ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. The implementation follows the lazy initialization approach, meaning that the singleton instance is created only when it is first accessed through the getInstance method.

After running the provided code, which includes the LazyInitializedSingleton class and a main method that creates multiple threads to access the singleton instance, the following observations can be made:

The singleton instance is indeed created lazily, meaning that it is not created until it is first accessed by one of the threads.
The singleton instance is shared across all threads that access it, meaning that they all get the same instance with the same hash-code.
Since the singleton instance is accessed concurrently by multiple threads, there is a potential for thread-safety issues, such as race conditions, synchronization problems, and visibility issues. However, in this implementation, there is no synchronization mechanism or other means of ensuring thread safety, so these issues may occur.
The use of System.out.println statements in the run method of the MyRunnable class is not thread-safe, as it can lead to interleaved output from multiple threads. However, for the purpose of this exercise, it is sufficient to demonstrate that the singleton instance is shared across threads.
In summary, the LazyInitializedSingleton class provides a basic implementation of the Singleton design pattern, but it lacks thread safety and may require additional synchronization mechanisms to be used in a multi-threaded environment. The provided code demonstrates the basic behavior of the singleton instance when accessed by multiple threads, but it should not be used as a production-quality implementation without additional modifications to ensure thread safety.
